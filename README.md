# Plan your project

## Overview

**Throughout the rest of the term we’ll be working on the design of a complete independent website.** The subject matter independent project website is completely your choice.

*For the project plan, deliver 1 PDF with all the necessary plan documents inside: content inventory, sitemap, wireframes, logo, moodboard.*

---

## Details

Create all these subdeliverables and put them together into a PDF for submission and grading.

1. **Content inventory:** A table showing the content for each page: text, images, video, etc.; where you’ll get it, etc.
1. **Sitemap:** Include all 3+ pages & how they’re connected together.
1. **Wireframes:** 3 sizes (small, medium, large) for each of the 3 pages: minimum 9 wireframes.
  <br>Simple content prioritized grey boxes works well, even just paper sketches.
1. **A logo:** Must work well (or adapt to) these sizes:
    - `256px` wide, height whatever — your primary logo, displaying on the website
    - `64px` square — for mobile screens, social profile photos, bookmarks, etc.
    - `32px`, `16px` square — for favicons.
1. **Visual design/moodboard:** Type & type scale, colours, sample components (buttons, cards, etc.), consider accessibility & performance when making decisions; Do some sample patterns in Illustrator/Photoshop/XD to give your coding direction.
